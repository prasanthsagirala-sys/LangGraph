Post a good post in a social media platform. Iterate through the post to see for any any improvements to finalise the post.

Flow: Generate Post -> Evaluate. 
            If needs improvement, Generate again/improve the post and Evaluate again. 
            This step repeats until Evaluator says, All good.
            If doesn't need improvements, Post it on Social Media
